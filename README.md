## Introduction

This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental data structures. Each data structure is implemented in its own directory with associated test cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a clear and comprehensive guide to data structures for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prashant-singh-2001/DSA-With-Java.git
```

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can run the Java programs from the command line or import the project into your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

## Data Structures

### Linked List
- **Description:** A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Each element is a separate object with a data part and address part.
- **Files:** `LinkedListImpl.java`

### Stack
- **Description:** A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).
- **File:** `StackImpl.java`

### Queue
- **Description:** A queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
- **File:** `QueueImpl.java`

### Sorting Techniques
- **Description:** Sorting is used in various circumstances where one need to have the data in a particular order.
- **Files:** `SortingTechs.java`

### Hash Table
- **Description:** A hash table is a data structure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
- **Files:** `HashTable.java`
